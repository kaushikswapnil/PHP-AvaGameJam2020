extends YSort
# This can be thought of as the player object.

# # It has multiple Members (child nodes) that it manages. The leader Member (child node with index
# position of 0) is special. He has the Detect node which is a four RayCast2D system pointing
# South, West, North & East as expected. Apart from that the leader also gets the RemoteTransform
# which is used with the Camera. This has to be done to simplify Camera movement when cycling
# through Member positions. Without it, it would be a bit tricky to make the Camera move smoothly.

# # The Detect scene is used by the Walk behavior to verify adjacent encounters. It does this so we
# have a way of identifying which encounter the Party... encounters. This tirggers some changes in
# the in other Systems like Dialog etc. (to be further explored).
