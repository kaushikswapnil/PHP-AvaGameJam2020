extends Area2D
# An object with which the Party (Player) can interact on the Board.

# # It doesn't do anything other than play an animation when Party leader is adjacent to it
# and send signals to other systems. Its purpose is to be detected by the Party leader.

# # Check Party, Member & Walk behavior scripts for more information on being Detected.

# # Notes
# -----
# For future proof, this Node is added to "encounters" group. This is used when trying to detect
# encounters in Members' Walk behavior to potentially distinguish from other Area2D object types.
