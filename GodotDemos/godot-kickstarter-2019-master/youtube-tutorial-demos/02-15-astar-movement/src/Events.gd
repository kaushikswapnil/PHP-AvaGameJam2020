# Events autoload script for emitting signals.
 
# # It makes life much easier when we don't have to worry about the paths to different systems/nodes
# in order to connect their signals. This also means that all nodes using it will be in direct
# interdependency with this Node. This is not much of a problem though. All Nodes and systems
# are decoupled which means that if we want to use some component in another project that doesn't
# use the same Events class, we can just remove every line with `Events.` in it and we're good to go.


# events emitted by Party members or behaviors attached to these
signal party_member_setup(msg)
signal party_member_walk_started(msg)
signal party_member_walk_finished(msg)

# encounters emit this event when mouse enters over them so they can be correctly interpreted
# as obstacles when trying to move the Party
signal encounter_probed(msg)
