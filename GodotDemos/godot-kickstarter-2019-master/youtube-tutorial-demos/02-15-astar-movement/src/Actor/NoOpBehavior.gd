extends Node
class_name Behavior
# Behavior base class offers two functions: `run` & `is_noop`. This is pretty much the Command pattern
# addapted to Godot.

# # A Behavior is a single functionality exposed through the `run(msg: Dictionary)` function.
# For example, in OpenRPG, to make the player walk and react to obstacles, we use two individual
# Behaviors: Bump & Walk.

# # Walk doesn't know how to stop on obstacles, it just knows how to move the player from point A to
# point B. This means that checking for obstacles has to be done prior to calling the walk behavior
# and if indeed there's an obstacle, the bump behavior is used instead.

# # The Actor is the one in charge of rerouting information to Behaviors.

# # Notes
# -----
# This Node behaves like the AnimationPlayer Node in that it operate on `root_node`, which in
# Behavior's case is fixed to be $".." (ie. the parent Node).
