# Kickstarter Quest 3: Godot 2d and 3d course

This is our work repository for the Create your Own Games with Godot, the Free Game Engine [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/create-your-own-games-with-godot-the-free-game-eng).

We created over 10 MIT-licensed Godot demos, and dozens of [game creation tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8hcGWsyaIw&index=3&list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KEHh1pfBLVnLftf0of-tHQu).

We've also started working on [GDScript programming guidelines](docs/code-guidelines.md) for the community, and on a [GDquest UI theme](gdquest-godot-theme).

We're using **Godot v3.1** which introduces breaking changes. The demos won't work with previous versions.
